Lispect
=======

- A text-terminal automation tool similar to [expect(1)] of UNIX and Linux
- It runs on Windows 10 and later, and Linux
- The script is written in the subset of [ISLisp] ([gmnlisp])

[expect(1)]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect

**example.lsp**

$ `lispect example.lsp {SSH-OPTIONS} USERNAME@DOMAIN PASSWORD`  
â†’ login `USERNAME@DOMAIN` with `ssh` and input `PASSWORD` automatically

> [!NOTE]
> Some variable names have been updated for compatibility with recent versions of gmnlisp, but the old names remain available for now.

`lispect ./example.lsp -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 yourpassword`

```example.lsp
(if (< (length *argv*) 2)
  (progn
    (format (error-output) "Usage: ~A ~A {SSH-OPTIONS} USERNAME@DOMAIN PASSWORD~%" *executable-name* *program-name*)
    (quit 1)))

(let* ((ssh-param (subseq *argv* 0 (- (length *argv*) 1)))
       (password (elt *argv* (- (length *argv*) 1)))
       (sshpid nil))

  (with-handler
    (lambda (c)
      (format (error-output) "ssh is not found~%")
      (quit 2))
    (setq sshpid (apply #'spawn "ssh" ssh-param)))

  (expect*
    ("[fingerprint])?"
     (sendln "yes")
     (expect "password:")
     (sendln password))

    ("password:"
     (sendln password))

    (("Connection refused"
      "Could not resolve hostname")
     (quit 3))

    (30
     (format (error-output) "TIME OUT~%")
     (quit 4)))

  (expect*
    ("Permission denied"
     (expect "password:")
     (send #\U3)
     (wait sshpid)
     (quit 5))

    ("$ ")
    )
  (sendln "echo YOU CAN CALL SOME COMMAND HERE")
  (expect "$ ")
  (sendln "exit")
  (wait sshpid)
  )
```

Functions and variables
-----------------------

Parameters enclosed in curly braces {...} are optional and can be omitted.

- `(send {'interval MS} "STRING")`
    - Send STRING to the terminal
    - Specify the `'interval MS` option to make the program wait MS milliseconds before outputting each character
- `(sendln {'interval MS} "STRING")`
    - send STRING and Enter-key to the terminal
- `(expect {'timeout SEC} "STRING-0" "STRING-1" ...)`
    - Wait until STRINGs are found on the terminal
    - When STRING-n is found on the terminal, it will return n
    - If a timeout occurs after SEC seconds have elapsed, it returns -1
- `(expect* ("STRING-0" COMMANDS-0...) ("STRING-1"...)... (SEC COMMANDS-FOR-TIMEOUT...))`
    - When STRING-n is found on the terminal, COMMANDS-n will be executed
    - After SEC seconds have elapsed, COMMANDS-FOR-TIMEOUT will be executed
- `(spawn "COMMANDNAME" "ARG-1" ...)`
    - Start the executable file and it returns Process-ID
- `(wait PID)`
    - Wait the process specified with PID
- `(getenv "NAME")`
    - Get the value of the environment variable NAME
- `(setenv "NAME" "VALUE")`
    - Set the value of the environment variable NAME as VALUE
- `*argv*` (formerly `ARGV`, now deprecated)[^1]  
  The list of command-line arguments.
- `*program-name*` (formerly `PROGRAM-NAME`, now deprecated)[^1]  
  The path to the script.
- `*executable-name*` (formerly `EXECUTABLE-NAME`, now deprecated)[^1]  
  The path to the Lispect executable.
- `*match*` (formerly `MATCH`, now deprecated)[^1]  
  The matched string in an `(expect*)` block.
- `(catch TAG-FORM FORM...)` and `(throw TAG-FORM RESULT-FORM)`
    - Non-local exits. See also [ISLISP draft - 14.7. Non-local exits](https://islisp-dev.github.io/ISLispHyperDraft/islisp-v23.html#non_local_exits)
- `(block TAG FORM...)` and `(return-from TAG VALUE)`
    - Defines a block with a tag TAG. `(return-from TAG VALUE)` exits from the block early, returning VALUE. Useful for controlling flow within a section of code without exiting the entire script.
- `(apply FUNCTION ARG-LIST)`
    - Calls FUNCTION with arguments supplied as a list ARG-LIST.  
      Useful when the number of arguments is dynamic or collected in a list.  
      Example:
      ```lisp
      (setq args (list "-p" "2222" "user@host"))
      (apply #'spawn "ssh" args)  ; equivalent to (spawn "ssh" "-p" "2222" "user@host")
      ```
- `(with-handler HANDLER FORM...)`
    - When an error occurs in `FORMS...`, call `HANDLER`.
      See also [ISLISP Draft - Operations relating to condition handling](https://islisp-dev.github.io/ISLispHyperDraft/islisp-v23.html#s_with_handler)

[^1]: These variable names were changed to accommodate gmnlisp v0.7.10 and later, in which symbol names are case-insensitive. The new format avoids potential name conflicts.

Other functions are defined on [ISLisp]
